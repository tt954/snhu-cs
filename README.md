* **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is a crucial aspect of software development. It requires understanding the requirements and needs of users and transforming them into a functional application. Creating "user stories" is a technique that aids this process. User stories are concise descriptions of a feature from the perspective of a user. They capture the user's expectations and needs in a simple format. By utilizing user stories, developers can better empathize with users and ensure that the application addresses their specific requirements. User stories also act as a communication tool between developers, users, and stakeholders, fostering collaboration and alignment throughout the development cycle.
  
* **How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
Approaching program development involves considering various factors and finding the suitable method methodology. One such approach is incorporating agile processes into the development workflow. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, emphasize iterative and incremental development, constant collaboration, and quick adaptation to changes. Agile frameworks facilitate regular feedback, continuous improvement, and the ability to deliver working software in shorter development cycles. Incorporating these agile processes in future development work can lead to more efficient and effective development, better team collaboration, and improved overall project outcomes. 

* **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
Being a good team member in software development goes beyond technical skills. It encompasses qualities and behaviors that contribute to effective teamwork and successful project completion. A good team member actively communicates and collaborates with teammates, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and working towards a common goal. They listen to others' perspectives, respect their opinions, and contribute constructively to discussions. They demonstrate accountability, take ownership of their tasks, and deliver work on time. Additionally, a good team member is open to feedback, continuously learns and grows, and supports their colleagues in achieving shared objectives. Cultivating these qualities of a good team member fosters a positive team environment and maximizes the potential for successful software development projects.
