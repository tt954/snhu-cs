## CSS 255 Module Eight Journal 
* **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
The DriverPass project aimed to develop a web-based system to manage driving lesson reservations and related administrative tasks. The client, DriverPass, wanted to bring changes to the driver training services by making sure that their customers are well-prepared and confident when taking their driving tests. They needed a system that would enable customers to book, modify, and cancel driving lessons through different packages while allowing admins to track reservations, generate reports, manage user accounts, and integrate updates from the DMV.

* **What did you do particularly well?**
I effectively identified and incorporated the key functional and non-functional requirements for the system, making sure that the design met DriverPass' needs. Additionally, I created various diagrams, such as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams, which helped visualize the interactions and processes within the system. 

* **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I interpreted DriverPass' needs by closely analyzing the interview transcripts with Liam and Ian, ensuring all requirements were accurately captured. Implementing these needs into the system design involved creating use cases and functional requirements that directly addressed the client's specific needs, such as the ability for customers to book and manage driving lessons. Considering the user's needs is crucial because it ensures the system is user-friendly, meets expectations, and effectively addresses the problems the client is facing, leading to higher satisfaction and better system usability. 

* **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
If I could choose one part of these documents to revise, I would focus on enhancing the clarity and detail of the technical requirements. I would improve it by adding more specific examples and scenarios to better show how each requirement supports the overall goals and needs of DriverPass.

* **How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
My approach to designing software is to first thoroughly understand the client's needs. Through detailed discussions and documentation, I gather what the system is required to do. Then, I create diagrams like use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams to illustrate and help stakeholders better visualize the system's functionality. In the future, I can use techniques such as prototyping and iterative development to gather continuous feedback and refine the system. These strategies help ensure that the final product is aligned with the client's vision and user expectations.
