## CSS 305 Journal Submission
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company sought Global Rain's assistance in enhancing the security of its web application. Specifically, Artemis Financial required the addition of a secure communication mechanism through data verification, such as a checksum, to ensure the integrity of client data and financial information. Our task was to identify and address security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial’s existing software and implement security features that complied with industry best practices.

During the vulnerability assessment, one of the key improvements was identifying the use of a robust encryption algorithm (SHA-256) for generating checksums. This was an essential step in ensuring data integrity and securing communication between the client and server. Secure coding is important because it mitigates risks such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and other cyber threats. Security adds immense value to a company’s overall well-being by protecting sensitive information, maintaining client trust, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, particularly in industries like finance where data confidentiality and integrity are of greatest importance.

One of the challenges during the vulnerability assessment was ensuring that refactored code did not introduce new vulnerabilities. This required careful review and testing. To increase layers of security, I enforced HTTPS for secure communication, implemented a secure API design, and focused on error handling. In the future, I would utilize automated tools like static code analyzers and vulnerability scanners to assess potential weaknesses in the code. Combined with manual code reviews, these tools will help identify vulnerabilities early.
